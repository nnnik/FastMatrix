# MCode Src
This folder contains all the source files of the Machine Code and the script thats used to compile them
The compile script requires my MCodeEx compiler in a specific location relative to it's current position
The FastMatrix and MCode-Ex folder are contained in the same folder
That means if you are currently in this folder then go upwards twice and enter a folder named MCode-Ex you need to arrive at my compiler in order for this script to work
